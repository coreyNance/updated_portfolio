                <p>Previous car sales consultant for a little over 13 years, high level of success by maintaining a perfect 100 customer satisfaction score while averaging 25 car sales a month. These achievements allowed me to make the top 100 sales consultant list in the Northeast Business Center.  Next family-oriented move, to be a Motor Coach driver for a little over 3 years. While on this job I received countless praise for my professionalism with riders and my camaraderie with co-workers.  These achievements attributed to the company’s consideration for an Operations Manager Position within that short time period. All while attending school at Southern New Hampshire University to get my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering which I currently maintain a GPA of 3.96 and also attend University of New Hampshire's Coding Bootcamp for software development. From my various roles and successes, makes me a great addition to your development team.
